            <p>
                Bengali: বাংলাদেশ, pronounced ['baŋlaˌdes] (About this soundlisten), officially the People's Republic of
                Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world, with a
                population exceeding 163 million people in an area of either 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi) or
                147,570 square kilometres (56,980 sq mi),[7][16] making it one of the most densely populated countries
                in the world. Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, Myanmar to the
                southeast, and the Bay of Bengal to the south. It is narrowly separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the
                Siliguri Corridor; and from China by the Indian state of Sikkim in the north, respectively. Dhaka, the
                capital and largest city, is the nation's economic, political, and cultural hub. Chittagong, the largest
                seaport, is the second-largest city.
